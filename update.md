# NADE Project Updates

## 2025-10-16: Repository Structure Cleanup

### What Was Done
Reorganized the entire repository structure to eliminate clutter and improve organization:

#### Created New Directory Structure
- `docs/` - All project documentation
- `scripts/` - Build and deployment scripts
- `packages/` - Distribution packages for both platforms
  - `packages/linux/` - Linux binary distribution
  - `packages/windows/` - Windows source distribution

#### Moved Files to Proper Locations

**Documentation → docs/**
- DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md
- PLATFORM_PACKAGES_READY.md
- FINAL_DELIVERABLES.txt
- NDA-SPECS.md

**Build Scripts → scripts/**
- build_windows.bat
- deploy_windows.bat
- deploy.py
- create_platform_packages.py

**Distribution Packages → packages/**
- NADE-v1.0.0-Linux-x64.tar.gz
- NADE-v1.0.0-Windows-Source.tar.gz
- readytoship_linux/ → packages/linux/
- readytoship_windows/ → packages/windows/

#### Cleaned Up
- Removed old `readytoship/` folder (redundant)
- Removed empty `readytoship_linux/` and `readytoship_windows/` directories
- Consolidated all distribution files into `packages/`

### Final Repository Structure

### Benefits
- **Clear organization**: Docs in docs/, scripts in scripts/, packages in packages/
- **No clutter**: Removed redundant folders and files
- **Easy navigation**: Logical directory structure
- **Better maintenance**: Easy to find and update files

### Previous Work (Earlier in Session)
- Fixed audio recording timing (100% accurate now)
- Implemented auto-load Python plugins button
- Created separate Linux and Windows distribution packages
- Replaced PyAudio with sounddevice for reliability
- Fixed crashes on pipeline stop
- Improved audio quality

### Current Status
✅ Repository is clean and well-organized
✅ All distribution packages are in packages/ directory
✅ Documentation consolidated in docs/
✅ Build scripts organized in scripts/
✅ Ready for development and distribution
